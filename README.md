Network Anomaly Detection Using Deep Learning Models
Overview
Our graduation project focuses on network anomaly detection using deep learning models. The project consists of two main parts:

Deep Learning Models:
We worked with two datasets: UNSWNB15 and KDDCUP99.
For the datasets, we explored several models:
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
Deep Neural Networks (DNN)
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
These models were trained to detect anomalies in network traffic.
Flask Application:
We created a Flask application to visualize our project.
Features:
Train and test models on new data.
Display analysis and visualizations.
Allow users to select pre-trained models and predict labels for new packets.
