# Network Anomaly Detection Using Deep Learning Models
## Overview
This is a graduation project that focuses on network anomaly detection using deep learning models. This project consists of two main parts:

### Deep Learning Models:
We worked with two datasets: UNSWNB15 and KDDCUP99. <br>
For the datasets, we explored several models:
* Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
* Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
* Deep Neural Networks (DNN)
* Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
These models were trained to detect anomalies in network traffic.
### Flask Application:
We created a Flask application to visualize our project.<br>
#### Features:
- Train and test models on new data.
- Display analysis and visualizations.
- Allow users to select pre-trained models and predict labels for new packets.
